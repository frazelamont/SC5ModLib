SC5ModLib
=========

my mods for simcity 5 (2013 version)

I place all mods under SimCityData\*.*, maybe this isn't the correct place but they seem to work when placed here, also MY MODS ARE DESIGNED FOR OFFLINE USAGE ONLY, apologies for the caps lock there but this is a key point (tbh I've not used the multi-player mode at all yet).

copy the script below into the same folder, from the SimCityUserData\EcoGame
(used to break my mods, now it makes them work after the 10.1 update)

SimCity-Scripts_287520926.package
