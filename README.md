=========

my mods for simcity 5 (2013 version)

I place all mods under SimCityData\*.*, maybe this isn't the correct place but they seem to work when placed here, also MY MODS ARE DESIGNED FOR OFFLINE USAGE ONLY, apologies for the caps lock there but this is a key point (tbh I've not used the multi-player mode at all yet).

copy the script below into the same folder, from the SimCityUserData\EcoGame
(used to break my mods, now it makes them work after the 10.1 update)

SimCity-Scripts_287520926.package

though they may be needed for other mods, one to check.

Workaround 01 - without script file above
-----------------------------------------
create new region, save instantly, quit simcity then reload it.  Either browse to the region via 'play' or access the last region you had open via 'resume', my mods only work after doing this for some weird reason

Workaround 02 - with script file above (10.1 update forces this weirdness)
--------------------------------------
create new region, save instantly, quit simcity then reload it.  only works when region is set to the resume button
