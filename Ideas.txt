get the extended rollover to show:
	power
	garbage
	water
in both amounts & by cost (exchange rate x amount)
---------------------------------------
add uni research ui to college, and move school of engineering there
----------------------------------------
separate out metals hq commerce div building to be separate one, for
setting/managing the exchange rates (also see if these rates exist
for the police, health, fire, mass transit) - commerce done in trading
so the commerce buildings of drilling, mining, electronics can be shifted
to other functions - mostly cost i'm not wise in the ways of 3d modelling
---------------------------------------------
find out from maxis if exchange rate can be 
attached to uni research, then block it from other uni's in region, so can
license as patent via exchange rate to other cities in region and they can't
research it once it has been completed or started.
----------------------------------------------
figure out how to create counters for amount of shares held in companies who
use exchange rate to sell services/produce.  And to see how to sell them, and
if maxis can advise how to get the game then creating competitors ...like a-train
but really updated for simcity 2013
